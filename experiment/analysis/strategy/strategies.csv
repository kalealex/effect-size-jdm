05ffb347,densities,TRUE,i'm comparing them at the midpoint. I am trying to estimate which is better and which will lead to a higher average goals,basically the same as i stated before. i measured the midpoint on each chart,Mean difference,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
089ac808,densities,TRUE,I look at the spread of the area under the curve: the more spread the better; and I look at how displaced to the right the new curve is the farther to the right it is the better.,I first looked at how displaced to the right the new curve is which indicates how many more points on average the team would make with the new player. The farther to the right it is the better. I then looked at the spread of the area under the new curve: the more spread the better.,Gist distance; Variance,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,High,No,Yes,No,No

1e977a81,densities,TRUE,I tried to pay when the player can score us a moderate amount of points.,If there is a greater score threshold with the new player I get them.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
1f4dff39,densities,TRUE,I just tried to figure if it was a substantial increase and if it would be worth paying for a change.  If it wasn't a substantially better player it wouldn't be worth switching so I'd keep it the same.,I just tried to focus on whether I had good odds of getting reimbursed the 8 cents for switching.  If the increase in player skill was only marginal - I didn't risk the 8 cents.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
24c058b3,densities,TRUE,I looked at how much of the bell curve was on the right side of my blue chart.,I basically used the dotted vertical line and decided how much of their bell curve was past it to judge the chances. If more than 70 percent was across that I always picked to hire the new person.,Area across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No

33e71012,densities,TRUE,I wasn't particularly scientific about it honestly there was just a rough threshold where I considered the benefit of bringing on the new player outweighed the cost of them.  Pretty much any new player that had a tangible increase in our odds I hired and it seemed to work out fairly well.,"Pretty much the same as in the first task.  The slight differences didn't really affect the rather basic way I used the charts which again was just to view them in a very linear ""Anything above this threshold is hired"" kind of way.  I didn't feel the need to try to get more analytical than that since it seemed to work out fairly well.",Distance across threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

377416c9,densities,TRUE,I looked for how far away the red graph was from the blue graph but to be honest I'm not really sure I understood how it worked.,I can now say that I definitely did not understand how the charts really worked especially when you had to input the x out of 100 part.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes
37f6a1f9,densities,TRUE,I looked at how much value the new player was going to add to the team,I looked at where the chart was projected to be highest without hte new player and if it was within a certain level I decided to sign the player,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
398f7c2a,densities,TRUE,If it looked like I was going to have a great chance of a rise I would go with it,when the wave was higher i would choose it and most of the time it would expand out  a longer distance so it would show a higher likelihood of it gaining more points.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
403ad41e,densities,TRUE,I base the graph by each horizontal difference instead for the vertical lines. I have little understand of the graph I am basing the whole thing about how correctly my understand of the graph.,Looked for a minuscule difference between the two.

461b21f8,densities,TRUE,I'll pay for the new player if there's about a 60 or better chance that it will help me earn the reward.,Anything above a 60 (in my prediction) was usually enough for me to buy the new player. Anything under and I'd keep the current player.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
49bd1652,densities,TRUE,I looked at where the red and blue graphs were in relationship to one another. I also looked at how wide the variance of the graph was. If the graph for adding a player was significantly further to the right I selected that option.,Similar to the first round I considered where the graphs were in relation to one another as well as the width of the variation. Smaller variation would result in more substantial changes due to horizontal movement on the graph.,Variance and gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No

520c2707,densities,TRUE,In the beginning I was slightly confused but caught on half way through. I started trying to judge how far ahead the total mass of the red object was of the blue one and pay attention to their shapes.,I tried to judge how far ahead the total mass of the charted color was taking into account the shape of the graph itself since it changed. Then I tried to attribute a value to that increase in distance.,Variance and gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes
55bb5d25,densities,TRUE,If it's close I try not to buy. If the new player is higher I weigh the options.,The same as before weighing options per chart I wish it had told me clearer I was out of the second phase of practice too.,Gist distance ,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

5ac9e64c,densities,TRUE,I looked for a very small tail end on the slope,Although I thought I was doing good on the first trial i realized that buying players too much had a high cost so I only bought a player if there was no doubt in my mind that it was worth it. Close to 100% over the line,Variance; Distance across threshold,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Low,Yes,No,No,No
5e551263,densities,TRUE,I thought about the expected value of paying for the player iver keeping my original team. I didn't calculate it out but thought more intuitively,I tried to use the charts to see what percent change there was between the two scenarios,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
6267f51f,densities,TRUE,I looked at the improvement that the player expected to bring and I feel that it is significant enough for the cost I decide it is best to get the new player. Generally it seems that I should chosen lower amounts of improvement than I have so far based on some of the reported results.,I looked at the charts and if I felt that the average improvement was greater than the cost then I decided it was worth pursuing the player.,Point threshold; Mean difference,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
66782ce7,densities,TRUE,It depended how large the red bell curve was and how far it extended. If it was skinny I tended not to choose to buy a new player.,The same way I did before except I paid for the new player if the red was closer to 150.,Variance; Gist distance; Point threshold,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,High,Yes,No,No,No

74617a23,densities,TRUE,I'm comparing the shape of top two graphs to spot a differential there then I'm looking at how many more points the top version is getting and where the overlap is.  Based on that I'm making an educated guess.,This is hard to explain without visual aids!  I was looking at how closely the graphs matched.  Then if there was a difference I was trying to see how many more points the red graph gave over the blue to see if it was worth buying the player.,Variance and gist distance; Distribution overlap,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No
776b7d03,densities,TRUE,I used the charts to see how much more value a player would add and if it would only keep me around 50% I would not waste the money on paying for adding him.,I looked at how far from the first line of 100 it would move me up to such as close to 150.  The closer it was the more I was willing to risk paying for the new player.  Also a steeper curved line in red would make me hire the new player,Distance across threshold; Point threshold; Variance,Yes,No,Yes,No,Low,Yes,No,No,No

7c988f0c,densities,TRUE,I paid attention to when the red chart or bar representing the use of new player shifts from the left to right and more when the tendency is higher in terms of its appearance then i make rate based on the knowledge and that's what determines if i should use a new player or not.,I pay close attention to when the bar chart shifts from the left to the right side then make my judgement rate based on the knowledge if there will be need to use a new player or not.

80633027,densities,TRUE,I compare the whether the new player would be worth adding to the team compared to not adding it and whether the investment in them would be worth it. If adding the new player doesn't really improve the score then I don't invest in them otherwise I do.,I used the charts by determining the average of both adding a new player and not adding the new player to determine if the risk was worth investing into. If the new player had a better average of bringing in points I invested otherwise I didn't.,Mean difference; Point threshold,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No

9460dc2e,densities,TRUE,I mainly referenced the line representing the middle distribution of not buying the player and its relative position to the bell curve representing projected performance after buying the player. If the distance of each of the middle distributions was significant I would choose to either buy or not buy based on the degree of distance.,I used the dotted line and compared the distance of the top-most section of each bell curve and their proximity to each other. Depending on the degree of difference I would then make my decision on whether to buy or not buy the player in question.,Mean difference; Gist distance; Distance across threshold,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
9da9491f,densities,TRUE,I compare the expected value of winning for the top vs the expected value minus the player's fee for the bottom. If one is larger I pick that option.,Estimated the expected value of each outcome and chose the higher option.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
a0085c09,densities,TRUE,I looked at the top of the bell curve and tried to figure out if the bottom half of the top curve converged with the bottom curve.

a2c3eb42,densities,TRUE,Compare the areas to the left and right of the line if it made the chances significantly better I'd buy the player.,If the chances of winning were significantly improved per the chart I'd pay for the new player.  I tried to compare the areas to the left ant right of the payout line.,Area across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
a450e2b5,densities,TRUE,I'm looking for how much closer the other person's data would get me to winning an award. If they are only a couple points off from me and the distribution is fairly narrow I'm probably not paying for them.,I kept looking at the distribution with the new player added. If it was a wider distribution I was more likely to pay for them. Narrower not so much.,Gist distance; Focused on red; Variance,Yes,No,Yes,No,High,No,No,No,No
a53e83f8,densities,TRUE,If the chart is better I first guessed the percentage of the bell curve overlap and then bought the player. If its the same I did not buy the player I was never able to acheive the full 3.17 M and i was still experimenting as I am only half way through trials,I am confused why I did not win when i lost .

bf40ecf2,densities,TRUE,I am looking for an increase in winning of around 5% to purchase a new team member. Anything under that estimate does not appear to be worth the risk of losing money for such as small percentage increase in winning.,I continued with my previous strategy of using around 55% of winning as the cutout for buying a new player. Given that the max bonus was higher than what I earned I probably chose too high for the cutoff.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
c1f1c47c,densities,TRUE,If the odds are greater then 55 then I choose to pick a new player,I looked at the top of the peak of the graph. But then I read that all above this line will win. So I tried that and it worked all but one time.,Mean difference; Point threshold,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
c313ae30,densities,TRUE,I looked at how far to the right the red line was. If it is farther right than the blue line then I know I need to buy the player.,I looked for whichever color was farthest right and predicted it would win.,Mean difference; Gist distance,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

dde640ae,densities,TRUE,At first I was slightly confused and used the 100/150 line to guess how many times the new player would score and then I started paying attention to the red and blue graphics to make my determination.,This time i paid attention to how far the top of the red graphic differed from the blue graphic and how much farther it stretched to the right compared to the blue graphic.,Point threshold; Mean difference; Gist distance,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes
e07c7c35,densities,TRUE,I am looking at total points the team could potentially earn with the new player before deeming whether I would pay for that player to join the team.,I did use the charts to gauge the chances of earning more potential points.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,

e4e2eb7f,densities,TRUE,I looked for curves that weren't equal but farther to the right (higher points) and bought them. If they were equal I wouldn't bother adding them as i wanted better than a 50% chance before investing money.,I looked at the overlap of the two charts and if the the new player didn't have much overlap with the existing team (and was positive in point gain) I would add the player. If there was much overlap I would be less likely to add.,Gist distance; Probability of superiority threshold; Distribution overlap,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No

f7f69f44,densities,TRUE,I am using basic probability to make my descision,Same as before,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
f83e2827,densities,TRUE,I looked at the overall deviation how much further to the right (scoring more points) the new player was versus the old.

0b85d005,densities,FALSE,If it seemed like it was equally likely I just went with not choosing a new player. but if it seemed like there was enough of a difference then I went with the new player.,I just looked at how much change there was and tried to determine whicho ne seemed more likely to result in a win.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
171aa909,densities,FALSE,If the red is more to the right than blue use new player.

1983b52a,densities,FALSE,I mainly used the same things I did in the first half. It was easier to see the mean this time so I just looked at that (the peak usually) and the wideness of the distribution. Depending on the overlap I assigned an expected value to not taking the player (usually around $1.60) and that of the other distribution (depending on the width and extremes). Then I estimated the best play,I looked at the distribution that both had. If it was a big overlap with paying for the player having a large percent chance below the payline -- then I would do some estimation to see whether my expected value was higher by not paying the $1M versus paying the $1M for the better probability. It was mainly about the width of the distributions the peaks and the overlaps.,Variance and mean difference; Distribution overlap,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No

312d7914,densities,FALSE,Pretty much the same as before. I didn't change my strategy. I looked at how much overlap the red and blue has and the more overlap it had the less I was going to hire the new person. If I felt the odds were about 70/100 I hired the new person.,I just eyeballed the curve and looked at how far to the left the dotted line was in the red chart versus the blue chart and went with my intuition on whether it was a big enough difference or not.,Distance across threshold; Distribition overlap,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
32386833,densities,FALSE,I looked at the graphs and if the red was far enough over I paid for hte player and if it was close i didnt,if it was a big difference i usually hire the new player,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

41b77c8b,densities,FALSE,Again I just tried to gauge how well I thought I would do given the two chart figures and went with the one that seemed to have the best outcome.,I just tried to see what I thought the percentage would be that I would get the award within the desired threshold and went with it.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
45f5b8d8,densities,FALSE,same as the first half of rounds,If the new player substantially improves my chances of winning over 100 points i.e. 80% or greater I choose a new player.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
497bd6c0,densities,FALSE,I learned the more I did was looking at how much above 100 points the bell curve was. If it was somewhat more than 60% higher than 100 I paid for the player.,I look at my chances w/o and how much the new player would help,Area across threshold; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
4bc32236,densities,FALSE,I attempted to use the data of the projected score to decide if the new player was needed. I used my the projected results to make the best choice for the team. I looked at the curve of the Hump showing the scores as well as the labeling information on the axis.,I use the charts to attempt to determine the likelihood of a better score. I compare the score before the new player and the predicted results of their addition to the team.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
4c91fd32,densities,FALSE,I used the average amount of points I would gain by comparing the peaks mostly.  I also took how big the spread is into account as well.,I judge based on how often the new player would increase points and also by how much they would increase them,Gist distance; Variance and mean difference,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No
4d2fde8e,densities,FALSE,even more fun! I like this. Do more!!  Oh yea I used the bell curves to see where the percentage would be and went off of that. I went with anything over 80% as it would pay and I was correct.,fun. Lets do more!,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
4e19954d,densities,FALSE,I took it as the father apart the graphic/mountain representing the new player was farther apart than the other the better chances of winning an award.,The more separated the mountain with the new player the better.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
50ba5287,densities,FALSE,The same was as before. I look at their relationship to see how many more points I would score with the new player.  And then chose on that basis.,I look at the relationship between the blue and red charts.  If it looked pretty much like I would get more points if I chose the player i would buy the player.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
52b51473,densities,FALSE,Again i looked at the distance between both. I looked at the curves to see a difference or similar size.,I looked at how close they are to each other. I also looked at the curve and how steep it is.,Gist distance; Variance,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No
5680daba,densities,FALSE,I used the dark bar inside the graphs to better estimate the likeliness that one would provide  better outcome than the other.,If I had roughly a 60% likeliness to win the award with the new player based on the charts then I decided to pay for the new player.,Probability of superiority threshold; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

69789ad4,densities,FALSE,It seemed like the projected points bar didn't really do anything. It was still possible to not win the award if my projection was past the threshhold. So I just kept paying attention to the bell curves.,I looked for the narrow bell-curve with the new players as they seem to be more deceiving than the wide bell curves. Otherwise I just looked to see how much of each curve had more portions of it above the winning threshhold.,Variance; Area across threshold,Yes,No,No,Ignored,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
6ace4f29,densities,FALSE,I looked for where the height of the curve was and how widely the points were distributed overall.,I tried to gauge if there was a reasonable enough chance of winning with the new player to justify the potential loss of money if they didn't end up helping the team. I tried to reason how much of a gain they would give based on where the dashed line intersected the bell curve.,Area across threshold; Variance and gist distance,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
6af080b5,densities,FALSE,I didn't pay for the new player unless I would have almost been certain to win the award.,I tried to win as often as possible.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
719ce45b,densities,FALSE,I took more risk in the second round. Still use new player to determine if it was worth it. If the average were about 55 percent or higher I jumped on it.,Basically looked at when a new player really upped the points and chose new player or when without new player exceeded threshhold> i chose without new player.,Focus on red; Point threshold; Mean difference; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
728812c3,densities,FALSE,Tried to pay for new player when average is over 100,I tried to choose a player if red section goes good over 100 and choose not to add new player when the difference is very small.,Distance across threshold; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
729037ed,densities,FALSE,Again I selected the new player if it felt worth it if they were mostly over the line. It depended on how close the middle of the red curve was to the line.,I looked for how much of the new player was past the line. If it was hardly any I didn't buy otherwise I did.,Focus on red; Area across threshold; Mean difference; Distance across threshold,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
74d18b10,densities,FALSE,I looked at both graphs and determent what my odds would be to win with the new player based on how the graphs looked.,I used the chart to determine how much better my odds where to score more points compared to a 50/50 chance if i didn't get a new player.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
771734af,densities,FALSE,I looked at how much higher the score was likely to be with the new player. If I felt the difference was less than 5% I usually didn't get the new player.,I just looked to see how much the new player would increase the chance of winning and decided if it was enough to be worth the cost.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
774c1309,densities,FALSE,I used them to determine if the percentage of over 100 was enough to benefit me vs not benefiting me.,I use the charts to determine if the investment will produce better results.  If not I don't invest in the new player.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,

8500f884,densities,FALSE,I tried to decide to play for the new player when the top image was a noticeable amount further to the right. It took me awhile to figure that out but once I did I was almost always correct.

8f5f96cf,densities,FALSE,I just compared to see how much further right it was from the 100 mark if it was far over then purchase the players and the closer it gets to 100 then the likelihood goes down,if the average points is higher that 100 by a good distance then there is a good chance of purchasing the player will also help the team,Mean difference; Distance across threshold,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No

90086ec0,densities,FALSE,If the chance was greater than 50% I would add the player.,I looked at the area of the bell curve to the left of the dotted line.,Area across threshold; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
9b21f900,densities,FALSE,I decided that it wasn't worth the risk to lose money and I only took a new employee if the odds looked like 65 or higher.,I'm only paying for the new player when I'm certain that I will receive an award. If it looks like I wont get the award either way it's better to save money.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
9b3362bb,densities,FALSE,I was trying to see how far apart the two charts were an if it was far enough I'd buy a new player. If success was achieved by gaining money with risk I'd risk more often.,I'm not a big risk taker so when it felt that it was close to 50-50 chance I would not often choose to buy a player. I'd do it every time there would be a higher chance (especially when above 60%). I was looking at how far apart the two charts were.,Probability of superiority threshold; Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
9b744a17,densities,FALSE,I tried to focus on the new player because the better the outcome.,I tried to focus on the new player the most.,Focused on red,No,,,,,,,,
9d083ea6,densities,FALSE,same strategy as before.,if the player was an asset I would pay for them. if not I would not,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
a016734f,densities,FALSE,by how much the points increased compared to the blue chart,if the red chart looked like it had a higher chance than the bottom one. was higher on the top than the bottom one,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

a152ec38,densities,FALSE,I did not figure out the chart. I came to the conclusion that the graphs were intentionally misleading or incomprehensible and just chose not to pay for anything and Kept getting money so I stuck with that. Maybe I'm not smart enough to understand but I didn't figure the charts.,how far away the red blob is from the line I can't make sense of this chart. utterly incomprehensible. if most of the blob is after the line i guess i pay for the player but it really doesn't work every time,Focused on red; Distance across threshold; Area across threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
a3804b76,densities,FALSE,I looked at how much of a difference there was in the position of the red and blue hills to determine whether to hire a new player or not.,I focused on the distance on the x axis between the blue and the red to make a decision.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
a5ce5619,densities,FALSE,I mainly focused on how much of the red chart was above the dotted line. If it was above by enough it seemed justifiable to get the new player since it would almost certainly give me a net positive on the round.,I don't really compare the two graphs too much. If the red chart is above the dotted line by a significantly large enough amount I generally pick up the new player since the chances of winning are high enough to justify.,Focused on red; Distance across threshold; Area across threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
a64dbd65,densities,FALSE,I used the same as before to see if the red would be more likely to score enough points to win. I also used the lines to see if the red average was higher/lower than the blue avera.,I used them to see if the new player would be more likely to score more points.,Mean difference,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
a85ec246,densities,FALSE,If the majority of the red graph had little overlay to the blue I would pay for the player otherwise kept it safe with not paying for the player.,If there isn't much of a change by adding the new player I am opting not to add them,Distribution overlap,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No
a87cf35e,densities,FALSE,Again like the last time I mostly looked at the size of the red graph to the right of the dashed line. The addition of a solid red bar didn't seem to indicate much of a change. I still looked for relatively high increases over the base chance of 50% to justify paying for the new player.,I mostly looked at how much of the red graph was to the right of the dotted line so that I could figure out how much more likely I was to succeed with the new player. Since the baseline was 50% I felt it needed to be a fair amount higher than that in order to justify the additional expense.,Area across threshold; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,No,Ignored,No,Yes,Yes,No,No

b3865f7c,densities,FALSE,I tried to use the charts to see when there was a larger chance to score more with the new player so that it would make sense to spend the money to buy them.,I tried to gauge if I would score a lot or a little more with or without the new player and tried to guess when it would be best to stay with what I had and when to risk it.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
b4ce5e7a,densities,FALSE,I looked for the degree of shift (or lack thereof) to the right - i.e. was the increase in the distribution enough to pay,I looked for how much the chart shifted to the right.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
bb6e9bc9,densities,FALSE,Same as before just used the dotted line and gauged it. The new lines on each chart that indicate the 'average' helped eyeball it a bit better visually. The further apart the two graphs the more you'd want to buy; the closer together the more you need to gauge the difference carefully and that's where that middle bar helps. Again sorry if this sounds like babble,I simply visually move the red curve down and gauge the percent difference. Then I imagine it much like rounds in a game and if an investment would be worth it should the difference be in the grey area. Sorry if that sounds convoluted. The dashed line helps quite a bit as well. The concept almost feels too easy as if maybe I'm not truly understanding the task,Distance across threshold; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
bf1a1582,densities,FALSE,Now I tried to use the chart where if it was a super sure win I'd pay for it but only if it was super sure. Mostly I tried to let my own team win without paying so that I got the extra bonus.,I used it to determine how much more likely I was to win with the new player. Mostly I used it to mitigate my losses. I tried not to pay for the new player if it looked like I still might lose and then would lose a million if I bought them.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
bf5180cd,densities,FALSE,I looked at the averages and most importantly the probability of whether the red (with player) would win the award (not whether it would necessarily be better than the blue player). If it looked like more than 75% chance of winning I'd bet otherwise I'd leave the team as is.,When there is a near-certainty of scoring more points with the new player I bring on the new player. If it's in the 60-70% range I look at how long the tails are i.e. how likely it is to lose the award despite having the player. If it's under 60% I leave it to chance and keep the existing payroll.,Probability of superiority threshold; Variance; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No

cf07454f,densities,FALSE,I stuck to the same strategy that I used before. It was hard to tell though whether it would be worth it to buy the player.,yes I am trying to judge how much better our chances are based on how far the graph is from the start. I the further to the right the graph with the new player is the higher the chances of us scoring more points with them I believe,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
cf3f0ef8,densities,FALSE,I relied on the same method as before using the slope of the curve and the data's position relative to the threshold.

d1f9af30,densities,FALSE,I did the same as last time - kept the players that looked over 70,I decided that if the graph looked like a 70% or above of winning with the new player I would get it. If it's below it I wouldn't.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
d3e2181e,densities,FALSE,NICE,NICE,Uninformative,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
d54d79e4,densities,FALSE,I tried to see how much better we would do overall with the red team than the blue team by seeing how close they matched up.  If the red was more than a few degrees away from the blue team I'd be able to see that easily with the visual.,I look to see how much better my odds are with paying for the player visually and then use my estimated percentage from there to determine if I want to spend the money.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

I didn't pay too close attention to how tall they were.,After doing a little bit I started only paying for ones that are passed 75% because when you pay it subtracts 1M.

e7c51079,densities,FALSE,I looked at the top chart. If I thought it was over 55% I would pay for the extra player.,I looked to see how much over the line the new player was.

f3d15689,densities,FALSE,I began looking at the chart as odds. The blue chart was always a 50% chance to win while the red chart varied based on how much if its lower end crossed the vertical line. I generally bought the new player if the red chart indicated there was at least a 70% chance to win.,I pay attention to the comparison between the bell curves. The vertical line was distracting at first but I've learned to ignore it. I buy a new player if the lowest 25% of the red bell curve is overlapping the highest 25% of the blue bell curve for example.,Distribution overlap; Area across threshold,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No

But I also paid attention to how many times the prediction lines feel within the desired range. If only one of the prediction lines was at the higher edge and more were within reach of the ones keeping the existing team then I tried not to pick the one paying for a new player.,Well I wanted to see how many times the predictions lines would come closer to the right with the new player as opposed to keeping my team without the new player. If it looked like there were more instanced to the right with the new player then I was more likely to play using the new player.

It seemed as though it was much more profitable to always hire a new worker costs aside.,I examined the charts for great numbers of variability among the option to not hire a new employee. If I felt like the dash moved too far left while the red dash remained stable or to the right side I chose to hire a new employee.

ed26e5a7,HOPs,FALSE,I saw how the line jumped around between the award threshold. I picked which player had the majority of the their line jump above the award. In the second half where it had the big colored line. I almost always choose the one that had its big line over the award threshold.

If the average indicated more than 55 out of 100 than I would pay for the payer. If it indicated less than 55 than I deemed it too risky to pay for the player.,Just tried to compare the two by focusing on one at a time and then determining a guess as to if the new player would be beneficial. I did this mostly by looking at one of the lines and counting how many times it was over the threshold. I then did the same for the other and compared the two.,Frequency of draws across threshold; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No

035075e7,intervals,TRUE,Just common sense I guess. If the estimate is more than 53% I pay for the new player.

0a3fcbca,intervals,TRUE,The length of the red and blue bars mean next to nothing and I'm not using them at all. The current team will always have a 50% chance of winning so the new player is the only thing to look at. Depending on where this spread is located in comparison to the dotted line is mainly what I have used.,I used the same tactic as before mostly.

0d9d2778,intervals,TRUE,The farther the red cross was from the blue cross the more likely I was to buy the player. I was looking for players that seemed likely to make a difference at least 70% of the time.,The smaller the red bar the lower score out of 100 I gave the player.

1134386a,intervals,TRUE,Looking at the charts and the different bar graphs that I have seen I am mostly trying to limit the risk of falling below the threshold to not get enough points in order to get the payoff.  If the red bar helps in that regard in a noticeable way then I will buy into it.  Otherwise if it is not a big shift then I don't and take the chances.,Much like the same from the last time I didn't have much of a bonus so paying the premium wasn't a big deal since I didn't have any to subtract from.

18fb3d4c,intervals,TRUE,I looked at the difference between the 100-point line and the vertical red line first to see how much closer we might get to 150. I then looked at the horizontal line to see what kind of spread was anticipated.  The longer that line the more comfortable I felt investing.,I first looked at how close the median of the red line was to 100 points and assumed that would determine the average points he got.

228aff43,intervals,TRUE,If there was more than about a 70% to win based on getting the new player I would pay him otherwise I tried to stick with my regular team.  If there was a wider span of possibilities based on getting the new player I tended to put more value in that.,I studied where the red line crossed the 100 mark and if it was entirely to the right of it I always paid for the player.  If about 70 or more was on the right side I chose the player and if it was less I went with my team as it was.

363cfa9e,intervals,TRUE,I estimated the chances out of 100 and then only bought a new player if it was 75 or above. That seemed to make sense to me since it's expensive to buy a new player so I wanted to make the risk as small as possible.,I decided to only buy a new player when the reward was over 75/100.

39b9f131,intervals,TRUE,High number means a better chance average with a much higher value is much more likely to win. Large range sort of negates a higher average if the two values are close. The system is fairly simple and the information given is rather sparse so complex decisions are not necessary.,Tried to estimate the range average and decide how likely a player was to score more. Anything significantly above 60% is worth paying for though the odds between 55-60% are quite low. Still better odds of winning than not.

If it was completely above the 100 point line then I would always buy the player.

daf95a13,intervals,TRUE,I looked at the overlap between new and old players and cut it in half to determine the likelihood (out of 100) that the old team beats the new. As for whether to hire a new member I just tried to weigh the odds based on how much the lines were on either side of the dotted award line and compare that to losing nearly 1/3 the reward if I hire someone. If it still seems like a good deal I go for it.,Well if the new member guaranteed an award it was obviously worth it but even if the new member just increased the odds heavily I still went for it because I'd rather have a high chance of a lower reward than a 50/50 chance of a higher one. That was easily determined by how much of the red line was on each side of the dotted line. Comparing how likely one team is to score higher was sometimes difficult for me as it could be difficult to tell if there is a slight difference between them or if I'm just imagining things.

820e1527,QDPs,TRUE,I just checked to see how much farther over the red team was than the blue and if it was quite a bit farther over I would pay for the new player.,Same strategy as before if the new player added more than what seemed to be 5% additional chance I would pay them.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
86a4dde3,QDPs,TRUE,I looked for the difference between without the player and with the new player. If it's above 60% or so in my reckoning then I go for it if not I don't. If I'm understanding this correctly then the further away from the vertical dotted line the better the chance that the new player will help win. But in the end it comes down to a gamble. Players might surprise me.,I tried to use the information to see if it was worth a gamble but I'm not sure I did it correctly because I didn't do very well with the bonus. Anyway I tried to determine if it looked like the chance to do better with the new player was worth the cost or if we could do as well without him. I have to admit I went against my instinct several times and was wrong. The times I did go with my instinct I was right. Most of the time I tried to use the data in the graph but like I said I am not sure I was doing it correctly.,Probability of superiority threshold; Distance across threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes
8988b673,QDPs,TRUE,I used them to determine how much better the new player would increase our score overall.

9566ffd0,QDPs,TRUE,Was trying to figure out how much wiggle room I had with percentages and paid more attention to my players I had rather than add one.,I did notice difference in getting a good profit was knowing how to use charts that changed from small dots to big dots.,Variance,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No
9e2f73b3,QDPs,TRUE,I see whether or not the odds of the new player making more goals is worth the risk of paying for him.,I tried to see if the average dots were above the line and use that to see if I wante dto hire a new player.,Mean difference; Point threshold,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No

a12d4173,QDPs,TRUE,When the new players and old team players points are close together then I keep my old team and when I see that the red and blue dot groups are seperated I then choose the new team player.,I used the red and blue dot groups.  They helped me to choose when I wanted to keep the same team members or to choose a new team member.  When the color dots were separated from each other then I would choose the new team member.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
a303cc41,QDPs,TRUE,I was assessing the difference between the average predicted scores as well as how many red and blue dots were in the overlap zone. From there it was a bit of a gut check on the probability out of 100 and whether it was worth investing in the new player. I roughly took 70+ as the threshold for investment.,Similarly I took the difference of the averages and the amount of dots overlapping (as well as how spread-out the dots are which is roughly an indictor of standard deviation).,Mean difference; Counting dots overlap; Probability of superiority threshold; Variance,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
a48d6018,QDPs,TRUE,More red dots above the line is more chances when paying for a new player.

cab6f856,QDPs,TRUE,When I thought there was close to or better than a 60% improvement with the new player then I went that route. I figured 60% is about 1/3rd from the base line of 50% to the line marked 150.,It was a little bit harder without the predicted number and without the line in the middle but I used the same strategy as before otherwise and counted the balls and estimated the percentage.,Probability of superiority threshold; Distance across threshold; Mean difference; Counting dots,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
cb22dbc7,QDPs,TRUE,i count how many dots are to the right of the blue line and multiply that by 5.  If the number is above 60% i buy the player,i counted the red dots to the right of the blue line and multiplied by 5.  if the number was higher than 60 i paid for the player.  i felt like the odds of scoring enough points when my chances were 60% justified buying the player.,Counting dots across threshold; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No

d913c1e4,QDPs,TRUE,I looked at how much the chart with the new player had moved to the right compared to the chart with the old players. If I felt like the shift to the right was significant enough then I chose to pay for the new player.,I didn't really change my tactics after the change halfway through. I still tried to gauge how much a new player would affect the score based on how much to the right the graph with the new player had shifted.

e49026d7,QDPs,TRUE,I counted the dots to the left of the dotted line to get an estimate of the times the team would do just as good without the new player. If the number was low then I took the reverse number out of 100 and if it was high I paid for the player.,I used the same strategy I did in the first half. I looked at the dots to the right of the team average for the new player if it were considerably more than those to the left I could the dots to the left to get a percentage. I subtracted that number from 100 to get an rough estimate of how well the new player would do. If the number were high 70 or above I took the risk and paid for the new player.,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
ea49ba27,QDPs,TRUE,I looked at the chart and gave an estimate about how far the new player scores are in comparison. If it was not 50 then I always add a new player.,I looked at how far ahead the red players were in relation to the blue players. I also looked at where the vertical line was in the graph. I then made a guestimate if the red players were further along the horizontal axis.,Gist distance; Point threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

05ecc61a,QDPs,FALSE,I compared how likely I was to win vs how much I would win if I was to use the new player.

0c9f97c5,QDPs,FALSE,I looked for a player that was predicted to change the score but atleast a prediction of 60 out of 100,I looked for a player that vastly changed the amount of points to be scored when choosing.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
0e7c7eb0,QDPs,FALSE,I'm not using any strategy because this chart doesn't make any sense. at 2 points they were lined up the same so I put in 50 and chose to not buy a new player and it failed. then it came up the exact same and didn't fail. there's no consistency.,if it looked like more than 40 i bought a player but it honestly didn't seem to matter. the chart didn't appear to reflect the feedback when submitted.,Gist distance; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

16ca3ec6,QDPs,FALSE,same as the last time.

176d1199,QDPs,FALSE,I tried to be comparative between the stats of the original team and the stats of the team after the change. The average was more so instead of having to divide you can just take the values from those between those points and then add the values from outside that point.,I was really just trying to compare the percentage of winning on the bottom to the new percentage change on the top. I would compare the number of percentages that fell in the same area to make my determination.,Distribution overlap; Counting dots in range; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No
1aca2879,QDPs,FALSE,Basically if the new player varried alot across the line needing to win.

The further to the right the red dots are the more points I am likely to score.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,Ignored,No,No,No,No,No
8071009a,QDPs,FALSE,This time I used the lines in the middle of the dots. I measured the distance between the two in order to get a sense of how much a new player might possibly contribute.,I compared the top to the bottom estimate to get a rough idea of the odds the new player would be worth the investment. The larger the gap between the middle (most likely areas) the more willing I am to hire.,Gist distance; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

9060c1ac,QDPs,FALSE,I used the chart about the same as last time.  Compared the red to blue to estimate percentages of wins and compared red to the dashed line to decide if I wanted to buy the new player.,I compared top to bottom to estimate the percent of the time red would beat blue but I only looked at the top chart (after the first few) vs the win threshold line to decide if I wanted to buy a player and usually bought if ~80% of red was passed the line.,Focused on new player; Area across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
9375dfb7,QDPs,FALSE,In the second part of the experiment I focused on the distance between the red line and the blue line.  I didn't have a specific distance in mind ... I just decided if I felt it was a significant enough distance to justify paying for the new player.  The lines made it easier to perceive the distance and the potential to gain more points.,When I am looking at the charts I am looking for enough of a difference in points to justify paying for the new player.

a664eb2c,QDPs,FALSE,I didn't pay attention to the new prediction line. I used my old method of counting the dots and comparing percentages to make my decision.,I counted the dots by hand and compared the percentages of each option. The vertical line helped in the sense that any dot that straddled or was on the right was counted toward the percentage. Anything over 75 (unless without new player was close behind) counted as a plus for adding the player.,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,Ignored,No,Yes,No,Yes,No

a7d3ce77,QDPs,FALSE,I attempted to use the same strategy as before where I tried to concentrate on the difference in distance between the red and blue circles.,Yes I used the chart to try to make a judgment on whether or not to add the new player. I looked at the difference in distance between the red and blue circles on the chart.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
a87d506c,QDPs,FALSE,I for the most part ignored the predicted value bar and utilized the distributions the way I had in the first round. If a large percentage of the distribution of the new player was above 100 I chose it and if not I decided the payment wasn't worth the risk and took the 50-50 chance of my team already.,I tried to weight how much of the new players distribution was above 100. If there was a high percentage above 100 (70%) I always took the new player to mostly guarantee a win. If it was <70% I went with the 50-50 odds of not paying and keeping my current team.,Focused on red; Area across threshold,Yes,No,No,Ignored,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
aad1101b,QDPs,FALSE,I did the same thing used each dot as 5% estimated for partial dots added the player when the total was 75% or above all the time less than 65% I did not add...in between I went by gut.,I let each dot represent 5% probability if the probability of winning by adding the player was greater than 70% I added him.  It took me the first couple rounds to develop this strategy,Focused on red; Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
ad574ec1,QDPs,FALSE,Was willing to take the risk almost every time if the chances were better than 51 percent of beating the threshold.,Most of the time it seems like it is a better option to pay for player especially if I think the chance is better than 55 times of 100 of beating the threshold.,Probability of superiority threshold,No,,,,,,,,
b094eff7,QDPs,FALSE,If the red dots were much further to the right I hired a new player. If they were equal I didn't hire. If the red dots were only a little bit ahead I made a gamble.,If the red dots were further to the right I hired a new player. If the red dots were in a similar position to the blue dots I usually didn't hire a new player. Sometimes they were very close and I simply made a guess.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
b2f8ddcb,QDPs,FALSE,I looked at the average between the two teams and which one had a better probability of earning more points.,I looked for significant changes and shifts in the graphics.,Gist distance; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
b95ac9f9,QDPs,FALSE,The vertical line help me to quickly identify the importance of the new player.,I compare the impact of the new player,Mean difference,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
ba7c0de2,QDPs,FALSE,I counted the dots and made snap judgments about where they stood on the graph.  I counted some dots as fractions and considered the overlapping areas with regard to how much more effective a team member might be.  I also considered the financial cost vs what it added to the team as it stood.,I counted the dots above and below the line and judged half dots as fractions.  Players that gave large advantages are worth it players who didn't move the needle or moved it downwards weren't.,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
bffd0f65,QDPs,FALSE,I went and did the same thing as before because I still do not know where to get my percentages from. I pay attention to how close the red moves to the 150 mark. I guess the percentages.,There were a few things about the chart I did not understand like the percentage but I did my best. I just paid attention to how far the red moved closer to the 150 threshold. I found it confusing because I did not understand how to get my percentages. I thought each colored dot meant 5% but when I used it in my calculations it was wrong.,Gist distance; Point threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes
c6bcd36b,QDPs,FALSE,Decided whether the average points scored was above the threshold significantly enough to warrant an $0.08 loss of bonus money,I weighed whether the difference in probability of scoring was significant enough to lose 1/3rd of my profit by buying the new player,Point threshold; Mean difference,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No
c757a5c2,QDPs,FALSE,I just made a quick mental estimate of the probability that paying the new player would increase my score.,I basically just look to see how much further to the right the option is with pay for the new player then try to make a rough estimate of the increase in probability of scoring more points.,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
cd2a30ff,QDPs,FALSE,I assessed how far apart the two figures are,every time I do a careful analysis of the chart,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
ce442486,QDPs,FALSE,I played it too safe. I paid for too many players. I would rather take less risks at losing if I had to do it again.,I tried for the player with the best win percentage most of the time regardless of price as anything close to a 50/50 resulted in failure.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
ce59a7a5,QDPs,FALSE,I only put money into a new player if the odds of them increasing the score was good.,If there isn't a large increase if a new player is added then I'm not going to waste money on them.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
cfd7920c,QDPs,FALSE,guessed,just a guess,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
d5cf5e60,QDPs,FALSE,Same as before except that I understood them better this time around. I still did really poorly though.,I just tried to guess the percentage based on where the dots were in the chart (it took me a while to understand it) and then make my decision to keep or pay based on that likelihood.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
d81a8d14,QDPs,FALSE,I chose slightly lower chances this round.,I chose to buy the player if there is a significant possibility in scoring more points.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
db894c10,QDPs,FALSE,If the average threshold for adding a new player was higher than without I would most likely pay for the new player but if the threshold was close to 50/50 I would not pay.,If the threshold of new player was significantly higher than without I would typically invest in the new player but if the threshold was close to 50/50 I would not invest.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
dbbe5256,QDPs,FALSE,If it seemed like a 70/100+ chance id buy the new player,the further the red dots are over the line the more likely it is to win the award if i choose the new player,Distance across threshold; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No
de921286,QDPs,FALSE,I looked to see which color was furthest to the right,I looked to see if red was further to the right,Gist distance,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
e11b1454,QDPs,FALSE,I used the chart the same way as last time but it was easier to use the extra line as a guide for my estimates.,I used the lines to divide it into sections for over or under 75% then tried to guess the percentage by breaking it up further.,Area in range; Point threshold; Mean difference,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
e28863ad,QDPs,FALSE,I used the charts to gauge my chance of success when taking on a new player.,Getting to the place where I make payout and choose to add a new player when the odds of winning are reasonable.,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
e70fae80,QDPs,FALSE,I looked at the lines and the numbers and tried not to be influenced by whether the chart was zoomed in or zoomed out.,I tried to ignore the size of the graphics and focus on the lines indicating what the difference would be.,Point threshold; Mean difference,Yes,No,No,Yes,Ignored,Yes,No,No,No
eac85f49,QDPs,FALSE,More red than blue balls on the right side of the dashed line.,More red than blue dots on the right side of the chart.,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
f09b4a48,QDPs,FALSE,Once again I tried to assess the level of increase between the two scenarios.  If there was a 10% or more uplift from the base scenario then I usually chose to pay for the player.,I try to assess the percentage uplift that the new player introduces - and I basically have a threshold of about 60% +/- 5% depending on the graph,Uninformative,No,,,,,,,,
f208afd3,QDPs,FALSE,I more or less used the same strategy,I tended to look at the amount of dots for each color on each side of 100,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
f2b59407,QDPs,FALSE,I guessed the performance by looking at how far apart the thick lines were on the graph on the blue and red points,I looked at the bottom area of the graph to guess the score,Mean difference,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No
f4ac5fd1,QDPs,FALSE,I looked at how many more red circles than blue circles there were on the right side of the line.,If the number of times the team would score higher with the new player is over a certain threshold then I choose to add the player to the team.  The threshold isn't an exact number but usually if it's 80 times out of 100 I'll add the player.  Or maybe a little lower than 80.  So really it has to do with how many red dots are on the right side of the line.,Probability of superiority threshold; Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
fc7314ce,QDPs,FALSE,See how different the scores are from each other and how tight the distribution is,Compare the odd that I can win the award by having the new player vs the odd of not having him/her,Variance,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No
fccb21d5,QDPs,FALSE,"My main criteria in deciding to hire the player was the magnitude of the shift of the ""before"" and ""after"" point distribution. Every after distribution had at least a slight improvement with the addition of a new player. However those in the 50 - 60% range did not seem to be worthwhile investments as the results did not pan out very often. I also looked at each ""standard deviation"" or columns in which the dots were organized. Those that had a long tail seemed to be somewhat better investments.",Looking at the charts I compared the two distributions and looked to see how much the distribution shifts with the addition of the new player. It seems that even a relatively slight shift rightwards is worthwhile. I did also take into account the tail of each distribution. Those distributions with longer tails seem to be more worthwhile as the possibility of even more points accumulates.,Variance and gist distance; Probability of superiority threshold,Yes,No,Yes,No,High,No,No,No,No
fee45dce,QDPs,FALSE,I started counting/estimating how many balls were still in the under category and remembering that one ball equaled five percent if it made my chances about 20% better or more I did it.,I just try and see if it looks like the new player makes it more than just mildly more likely to win the award and if they do I pay for them.,Counting dots across threshold,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No
